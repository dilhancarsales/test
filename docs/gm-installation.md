# GraphicsMagick installation  
  
This guide will help you install the required dependencies to get started!  
  

## Linux (Debian based)  
  
For linux users, you can run the following commands on your terminal.  
  
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ghostscript
$ sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick
```
  
Once everything is installed, the library should work as expected.  
  
## Mac OS  
  
For rich people, you can run the following commands on your terminal.  
  
```
$ brew update
$ brew install gs graphicsmagick
```  
  
Once everything is installed, the library should work as expected.  
  
## Windows  
  
Since I don't own a windows machine, I can't really write a guide on how to setup the required dependencies, if you're a windows user, and luckily able to setup both ghostscript and graphicsmagick, feel free to contribute by creating a pull request. Alternatively, you can donate a Windows machine. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
